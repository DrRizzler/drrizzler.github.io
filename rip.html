    <h1>In Conclusion</h1>

    <p>When we step back from personalities and parties, we notice an old truth:</p>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>systems defend themselves.</strong></p>
    </ul>

    <p>People who reinforce the status quo tend to rise.</p>
    <p>People who threaten it — even when sincere — tend to be resisted.</p>
    <p>This doesn’t automatically make insiders “bad” or outsiders “good.”</p>
    <p>It simply reminds us that public reactions to leaders are shaped by more than their words —</p>
    <ul><p>they’re shaped by whether those leaders fit comfortably inside the machine.</p></ul>
    <p>If we want a clearer picture of politics, we must judge leaders by their actions, not their tribe, branding, or media narrative.</p>

    <p>That’s how we avoid becoming passengers in a story written by someone else.</p>
